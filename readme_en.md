# Fernando Freitas Alves' README (Sr Engineering Manager @ Cobli)
TL;DR:

This page serves to show what it's like to work with me, especially for those who have never worked with me before.

## Hello, world!
I'm Fernando - Sr Engineering Manager of the Product Development teams.

Previously, I managed several teams at Cobli, such as the Ecosystems and Integrations, New Products (CobliCam and FieldOps), IoT, and even the BI team, among others...

# About me
- I started my career as a developer in 2002 when I was still studying programming at CEFET-SP.
- I started programming for desktop with VB6 and moved to Web using ASP 3 and PHP.
- I studied computer engineering at Poli -USP, after having studied a bit of Civil/Environmental Engineering; I did not finish either course. But during Cobli, I studied IT at Univesp and graduated at the end of 2022.
- I have been working with Python since 2009, most of the time with web and Django but I also developed desktop applications with QT.
- I have always liked entrepreneurship and business, ever since I was a child I wanted to start a company. I started a few businesses and made Exits in two startups where I was CTO. I can tell you how much money I made if you buy me a beer (In other words, it wasn't much XD)
- I naturally moved into leadership, I had a very bad first experience as a manager, completely unprepared which made me seek knowledge and actively think about how to improve.


## Why am I at Cobli?
Cobli for me was a great find. I wanted to join a pre-Series A startup that had an excellent team, where I could learn a lot about what happens in the growth phases of each round.

I also identify very much with the values of Cobli and believe that the culture here is very strong.

I like to see the impact on the Customer and see this becoming Results for the company.

## How can you help me?
- I prefer to work with people with a high sense of responsibility, this allows zero-space for micromanagement.
- If there is any problem, let me know as soon as possible. Negative surprises are the worst kind of surprise and leave little room for course corrections.
- More communication is better than less communication. It can be repetitive and give a lot of context.
- Bring your problems, dreams, and frustrations to me. I can help you in several ways, from helping you deal better with your schedule and colleagues to changing companies.
- Assume that other people have good intentions.
- Be flexible. My biggest difficulty with people is working with someone who invariably thinks they are always right.


## Working style
- I bring my whole self to work, not just the professional me.
- I believe in the servant leadership model.
- I prefer to have a bias towards action.
- My personality is ENFP.
- I love working with technology and I love working with people.
- I believe in win-win models and have a growth mindset.
- I prefer Scrum to Kanban, as I believe that timelines are excellent for deliveries. (But lately I'm rethinking this)
- I try to be organized, but I am chaotic and trust too much in my memory.
- I like to think about 1o1s in advance, but I will not always follow the list that I wrote in the lattice.
- I believe that hard work should be encouraged and rewarded.
- I like to bring out the best in everyone (If you want to run to achieve something quickly, I will let you run, but if you trip and need help, I will be there to help you)


## Communication with me

Email does not work with me. If it's urgent, tag me on Slack.
If it's very urgent, get my number on Slack and call me.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
- I get along well with people and feel that I can connect with (almost) everyone.
- I feel that I can exercise leadership more as a "guide" than as a "boss". I like to influence people to make the best decisions and many times I might prefer that someone make a mistake to learn a lesson.
- I'm not as calm as I seem. If I get hot-headed or think I'm going to say something I'll regret later, I tend not to give instant feedback, as I prefer not to say things in bad ways or that can be misinterpreted.
- I'm not very organized with my notes or my schedule.
- I have a hard time saying no if it's to help someone, which makes me work more hours to try to help with something, without losing focus on what I should be doing.
- I feel that I know little about Cobli's stack, however, I believe that my knowledge can help think of simple solutions.
- I feel that I do few benchmarks and that I go a lot on feeling. I don't think using feeling is wrong, as long as you are flooded with information.
- I excel at understanding people and relationships.
- I am skilled in driving cultural changes and feel I perform best during times of crisis.
- With each passing year as a leader, I feel less like a programmer :(

## Personal side

- I met my wife in the technical course, we started dating in 2002 but only got married in 2019.
- I am a father to Julia who was born in Jan/2022 and I live with her, my wife, and a little dog (Gucci).
- I have an Instagram account (I have been cancelled ðŸ˜‚ ) where I talk about career, programming, entrepreneurship. I like to talk about work with people and learn about how other places work.
- I quite like wine and beer although I am lazy to go out for a drink.
- I am almost always trying to start a diet and almost always practicing some physical activity, but I never engaged in the diet as I should.
- I don't watch many series, as I get addicted to them and want to finish quickly, so I don't like the feeling of anxiety they cause.
- On the other hand, I like to read. I'm not a bookworm but I can read 10 to 12 books every year.
